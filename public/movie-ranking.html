<h1>The Best Movies According to Christine</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>Inspirational Bollywood comedy about some college students and surprising outcomes in their future.</p>

<h3>Borat</h3>
<p>Comedy about a reporter from Kazakhstan who comes to the US and displays the most outrageous behavior and says the most un-PC things.  Could be offensive to some, so movie can't be taken seriously</p>

<h3>Life is Beautiful</h3>
<p>Very moving story of a father and son who survive the Holocaust by using humor and positivity 
   to get through each day.</p>
