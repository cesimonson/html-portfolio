<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Math and Computer Science from the University of Illinois, a Master's Degree in Mathematics from Purdue University 
  and my MBA from the Anderson Graduate School Of Management at UCLA.  My career path has given me corporate experience in areas of software engineering and 
  brand management. I have also taught mathematics at the college level. My talents in programming, designing electronic scrapbooks and maintaining a blog for 
  my 3 years at sea on a sailboat is an asset to being an effective web designer. </p>

<p>As a retiree, I find that I have the time and flexibility to put my background to good use as a web designer.</p>
